# Reachy Agent Expression Configuration
# Emotion-to-motion mappings for the mock daemon and visualizations
#
# Based on the 12 built-in Reachy Mini emotions:
# neutral, curious, uncertain, recognition, joy, thinking,
# listening, agreeing, disagreeing, sleepy, surprised, focused
#
# Additional emotions for richer expression: happy, sad, angry, excited, confused

version: "1.0"

# Head position ranges (degrees)
# pitch: -30 (down) to +30 (up)
# yaw: -45 (left) to +45 (right)
# roll: -20 (tilt left) to +20 (tilt right)
#
# Antenna ranges (degrees)
# 0 = fully down/droopy, 90 = straight up, values 20-80 typical
